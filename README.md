# Joker Studio Mod
 The definitive DIY Balatro mod.

## What is the Joker Studio Mod?
This mod adds 5 new Custom Jokers, all of which lack abilities and graphics. *Why?* Because that's where **you** come in!

## Introducing: Studio Cards
Studio cards a new consumable type that are your method of creating Custom Jokers.
There's 4 tiers of Studio cards:
- Basic
- Gold
- Platinum
- VIP

Each tier offers more benefits than the tier above:
- Higher base values for effects
- Stronger trigger conditions
- Additional palette colours (Config option, off by default)

## Making Custom Jokers
1. Find and use a Studio card to open the Joker Selector.
2. Select which Custom Joker you want to edit or spawn.
3. Click **Edit** to open up the Texture Editor.
4. Once you are satisfied with your texture, click **Save** to apply the texture and move onto the Ability Selector.
5. Cycle through the **conditions** (when the effect should activate) and the **effects** (what happens when activated) and once you've found a combination you want, click **Save**.
6. The Custom Joker is saved and added to your Joker area.

## Modifying Existing Custom Jokers
You can re-edit Custom Jokers you've already made. Do note, however:
- Changes will apply to all existing copies of that Custom Joker.
- The values on a Custom Joker effect will be based on the tier of the used Studio card, potentially overwriting better values from a previously used higher tier Studio card.

## Purging Custom Jokers
You can purge all Custom Jokers, reverting them to their initial, un-customized state through the mod config menu. Doing so will perform a brief game restart.
